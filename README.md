# Notes Premium
Never forget again by logging your personal notes and todo's into this app. Mark complete on your entries when you're done.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** JavaScript, MongoDB, EJS, HTML, and CSS

This project was built in a group. The user can create new notes entries or delete them by interacting with a Mongo database. Each entry can be marked with "complete" or "uncompleted" at will.
